The Person Search feature lets you quickly find photos containing specific VRChat users. Search by username, using romaji (romanized Japanese), and even search for multiple people in the same photos using AND logic.

## Overview

With Person Search, you can:

- **Tag-Based Search**: Add usernames as tags
- **Multiple User Search**: Find photos with up to 5 people (AND search)
- **Romaji Support**: Type Japanese names in romanized form
- **Favorite Users**: Save frequently searched names
- **User Directory**: Browse all users in your photo collection

## Prerequisites

Person Search requires VRChat metadata in your photos.

### Required Metadata

**What You Need**:
- Photos must have VRChat metadata attached
- Metadata comes from VRChat log files
- Requires proper Game Config setup

**How Metadata is Added**:
1. VRChat screenshot captured
2. VSA "Game Config" monitors VRChat logs
3. User names extracted from logs
4. Metadata embedded in screenshot

**When Metadata is NOT Added**:
- Photos from before Game Config setup
- VRChat not running during screenshot
- VRChat logging disabled
- Game Config not properly configured

**Setup Required**:
See [Game Configuration Guide](game-config.md) to enable metadata extraction.

## Troubleshooting

### Users Not Searchable (No Metadata)

**Symptom**: "No matching users" or empty directory

**Causes**:
- VRChat metadata not extracted
- Game Config not properly set up
- Old photos without metadata
- VRChat logging disabled

**Solutions**:

**Check Game Config**:
1. Open Game Config settings
2. Verify monitoring is enabled
3. Confirm metadata output folder set
4. Test by taking new screenshot in VRChat

**New Screenshots**:
1. After fixing Game Config
2. Launch VRChat
3. Capture new screenshot
4. Return to VSA (wait a moment)
5. New users should appear

**Database Rebuild** (if still not working):
1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Rebuild database
3. Restart VSA

See [Game Configuration Guide](game-config.md) for details.

### No Search Results for Existing User

**Symptom**: User appears in directory but "no photos found"

**Possible Causes**:
- Metadata partially extracted
- User appears in logs but not in actual photos
- Data corruption

**Solutions**:

**Verify Metadata**:
1. Find photo with that user in gallery
2. Open photo detail
3. Check user list in sidebar
4. Verify username spelling matches

**Database Rebuild**:
1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Rebuild metadata database
3. Restart VSA
4. Retry search

### Romaji Search Not Working

**Symptom**: Typed "tanaka" but no suggestions appear

**Causes**:
- Japanese input mode still active
- Incorrect romanization
- User doesn't exist with that name

**Solutions**:

**Check Input Mode**:
1. Verify keyboard shows English mode
2. Look for input method indicator (should show "A")
3. Disable Japanese IME if active
4. Try typing again

**Verify Spelling**:
1. Check user directory for correct spelling
2. Click that user to test
3. Try that exact romanization
4. Example: "haruka" vs "haruuka" (with long vowel)

**Full Spelling**:
- Try complete full name
- Not just first syllables
- Example: "yam" won't work for "yamada"
- Must be "yamada"

## Tips

- **Alphabetical Order**: Directory organized by Japanese 50-on, makes similar names easy to find
- **Multiple Devices**: Each PC maintains separate metadata - use to track different VRChat sessions
- **Performance**: Romaji search faster than scrolling through large user lists
- **Favorites**: Use liberally for frequently searched friends
- **Metadata Update**: New metadata added with each new screenshot; old photos don't gain new users
