**Step 4: Check Database**
1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Display "Database Info" from the Developer menu
3. Check "Total Photos"
4. If it shows 0, the firewall may be blocking the application

### JPEG XL Compression-Related Issues

#### Compression Does Not Start

**Symptom**: Auto-compression does not start at the scheduled time, or the scheduling feature is not working

**Possible Causes**:
- Auto-compression feature is disabled
- VRChat is running
- System time is incorrect

**Solution (Step-by-Step)**:

**Step 1: Verify Auto-Compression Is Enabled**
1. Open the Game-Side Settings
2. Expand Advanced Settings
3. Verify that "Auto-Compression Feature" is enabled (toggle ON)
4. If disabled, enable it and save

**Step 2: Check VRChat Status**

2. If it is, close it
3. Wait until the scheduled time after completely closing VRChat

**Step 3: Verify System Time**
1. Check Windows system time
2. Click the time in the taskbar
3. Verify the time is accurate
4. If incorrect, synchronize with the time server (usually automatic)

**Step 4: Manually Run Compression**
1. Open the JPEG XL Compression view
2. Click "Select Folder" to choose the folder to compress
3. Click the "Run Compression" button
4. Verify that manual execution works

#### Image Quality Degrades After Compression

**Symptom**: After JPEG XL compression, images appear corrupted or colors have changed

**Solution**:

VSA's JPEG XL compression uses **lossless (reversible) compression**, so image quality should not degrade. The following causes are possible:

**Cause 1: Original Image Is Already Compressed**
- Images output by VRChat are already compressed, so no visual changes from further compression are expected
- This is normal behavior

**Cause 2: Viewer Does Not Support JXL**
- Windows standard "Photos" app does not support JXL
- Install a JXL-compatible viewer:
  - IrfanView (Free)
  - FastStone Image Viewer (Free)
  - Other JXL-compatible image viewers

**Cause 3: File Is Corrupted**
1. Check detailed logs (Developer Mode)
2. If errors exist, redo the compression
3. If the same error occurs, the original file may be corrupted

### VRChat Integration-Related Issues

#### Metadata Cannot Be Retrieved

1. Open VRChat settings menu
2. Verify that metadata output is enabled
3. If disabled, enable it
4. Restart VRChat

**Step 3: Check Log Folder**
1. Verify the log folder path shown in Game-Side Settings
2. Open that folder in Windows Explorer
3. Verify that log files such as `output.log` exist
4. If not, reconfigure the log folder path

**Step 4: Take New Screenshots**
1. After completing all settings, take new screenshots
2. Metadata will not be applied to existing photos
3. Verify that metadata is applied to new photos

#### OSC Communication Cannot Be Established

**Symptom**: Camera parameters (such as VirtualLens2) cannot be retrieved

**Possible Causes**:
- OSC port numbers do not match
- OSC is disabled on VRChat side
- Firewall is blocking
- Port number is in use

**Solution (Step-by-Step)**:

**Step 1: Verify Port Number**
1. Open the Game-Side Settings
2. Expand Advanced Settings
3. Check the "OSC Port" (Default: 9001)

   netstat -ano | findstr :9001
   ```
3. Verify that no other processes are using the port
4. If in use, change to a different port number

**Step 5: Restart VSA**
1. Completely close VSA
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Restart VSA
4. Use the camera in VRChat

#### VRChat Launch Is Not Detected

**Symptom**: VSA does not detect when VRChat is launched (notification does not appear)

**Possible Causes**:
